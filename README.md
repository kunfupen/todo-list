# To-DO List Application
# Work In Progress

## Overview
I am learning sql with java to create a db.
The To-Do List Application is a simple Java-based program that allows users to manage tasks with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. It uses PostgreSQL as the backend database to store tasks and provides an interactive user interface for managing them.

## Features
- **Add Task**: Create a new task with a name, description, due date, and status.
- **View Tasks**: View all tasks in the system.
- **Update Task**: Update the task name and status.
- **Delete Task**: Remove a task from the database.

## Technologies Used
**Java**: Backend programming language.
**PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system for storing tasks.
**JDBC**: Java Database Connectivity to connect and interact with the PostgreSQL database.

## Setup

### Prerequisties
Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:
- **Java 17+**: [Download Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html)
- **PostgreSQL**: [Download PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- **Maven/Gradle** (Optional, depending on your build system)
