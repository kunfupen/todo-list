# To-DO List Application

Overview
I am learning how to use sql with java to create a db.
The To-Do List Application is a simple Java-based program that allows users to manage tasks with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. It uses PostgreSQL as the backend database to store tasks and provides an interactive user interface for managing them.

- **View Tasks**: View all tasks in the system.
- **Update Task**: Update the task name and status.
- **Delete Task**: Remove a task from the database.

Technologies Used
- **Java**: Backend programming language.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system for storing tasks.
- **JDBC**: Java Database Connectivity to connect and interact with the PostgreSQL database.

Setup

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:
- **Java 17+**
